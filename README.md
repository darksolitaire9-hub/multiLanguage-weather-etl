# Multi-Language Weather ETL Codespace: An Ongoing AI Learning & Building Journey

## üå± Project Vision & Curiosity

This project is a living experiment in **AI-empowered learning and hands-on technical discovery**.  
**Main goal:** To see how far curiosity (and AI support) can take someone in mastering and building a multi-language, robust Codespaces environment for data engineering and ETL with Python, R, Julia, Airflow, and SQLite.

**This README is not final‚Äîit's my learning log, doc, and story-in-progress.**

## üß† AI as Mentor and Accelerator

From design choices to debugging, AI acted as:
- Mentor and rapid explainer of confusing docs, CLI errors, and best practices.
- Brainstorming/solution partner‚Äîsuggesting alternatives and catching hidden issues.
- Pro tip dispenser: Everything from shell strictness to extensions.
- Reliable‚Äîonce I checked (and validated) assumptions with real commands!
- *Note*: The switch to [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for Python package management was a personal decision, not AI-recommended.

**Every config and fix here is both tried and AI-reviewed (unless otherwise noted as my own experiment).**

## üõ†Ô∏è What the Devcontainer Now Delivers

- **Stable Ubuntu 22.04 base image** (proven, not ‚Äúassumed‚Äù‚Ä¶ see Issues below)
- **Python 3 managed by [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** (pip removed after install; uv was my personal choice for speed/reproducibility)
- **R and Julia** full installs (robust, for Jupyter and scripts)
- **Apache Airflow** in persistent virtualenv with global CLI symlink
- **Jupyter kernels** for Python, R, and Julia (all auto-detected in VS Code)
- **Git, build-essential, curl, wget, etc** fully pre-installed
- **ffmpeg installed and reproducible:** Command-line media toolkit now built in for ETL, video/audio/image preprocessing, and data pipeline demos‚Äîinstall verified and logged.
- **GitHub CLI (`gh`) for modern repo/workflow management:** Added for instant GitHub ops (PRs, issues, discussions) directly from Codespaces or terminal.
- **VS Code extensions** for Python, R, Julia, Jupyter, and GitHub/PR flow
- **Aggressive scripting:** strict mode, error on fail, apt cache cleanups, version verifications
- **Improved `.gitignore` for collaboration/clean repo:** Now ignores Airflow runtime, database files, ETL outputs, media artifacts (mp4, mp3, jpg, etc), Jupyter/R/Julia/Python build files, and temp/editor logs‚Äîensures only clean, minimal, reproducible source and essential config is tracked.

## üõ†Ô∏è [2025-10-26] Automated Setup for Reproducible, Container-Native Development

**Update:**  
To make onboarding, re-building, and collaborating seamless, I‚Äôve added an auto-setup script and standardized all project files, Airflow config, and pipelines to live entirely inside `/workspaces/multiLanguage-weather-etl`.

### Quick Setup & Usage

1. **Clone the Repo:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_NAME]/multiLanguage-weather-etl.git
    cd multiLanguage-weather-etl
    ```

2. **Run the automated setup script (as root):**
    ```
    bash project-setup.sh
    ```
    - This:
        - Creates a dedicated project user (`etluser`) and sets a password
        - Ensures all Airflow databases, config, DAGs, and logs are always self-contained in the repo tree
        - Prepares correct permissions and folder structure for container, Codespace, or direct Linux development

3. **Switch to the project user for all development:**
    ```
    su - etluser
    ```
    (Default password is `multiETL2025!` unless changed in the script.)

4. **Start Airflow and get building:**
    ```
    airflow db init
    airflow webserver --port 8080
    ```
    (See setup troubleshooting below.)

5. **Codespaces/Dev Container:**  
    - The script can auto-run on creation‚Äîsee `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` (`postCreateCommand`)
    - Everything‚Äîpipelines, Airflow state, configs, experiment notebooks‚Äîremains inside a single, versioned, reproducible repo directory

**Why this matters:**  
- No more surprises about root-vs-user, home directory, or hidden state‚Äîif you can clone the repo, you can run the pipeline, reproduce results, or develop further.
- If future you‚Äîor a collaborator‚Äîhits an issue, the setup steps and troubleshooting will always match up with the README, script, and repo tree.

**As always: Every step, error, and solution will be logged below as the project evolves.  
Open issues or add clarifying PRs if you find an edge case I missed!**

## üß© Issues Faced So Far‚Äîand How We Solved Them

### 1. **Wrong Base OS: Alpine vs. Ubuntu**
- **Issue:** Codespaces often launched on Alpine Linux despite `ubuntu:22.04` config, causing failures for most installs, unexpected CLI behavior, and broken VS Code tooling.
- **Resolution:**  
    - *Simple check was key*: Ran `cat /etc/os-release` in the CLI and instantly revealed "Alpine" (not Ubuntu).
    - Updated `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to ensure `"image": "ubuntu:22.04"`.
    - Only then did further config and package installs work reliably.
- **Lesson:** Never trust documentation or AI guesses about environment specifics‚Äîalways check with `cat /etc/os-release` (or `lsb_release -a`) yourself!

### 2. **Missing Developer Tools**
- **Issue:** Alpine and minimal Ubuntu images often lacked `git`, `build-essential` and other baseline dev requirements.
- **Resolution:**  
    - Script now explicitly installs `git`, `build-essential`, and companions before anything else.  
    - Makes scripts and extensions run on first build.

### 3. **Python Package Management**
- **Issue:** Pip kept failing installs, virtual environments didn‚Äôt activate reliably, and dependency management was slow.
- **Resolution:**  
    - Switched to [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast, clean Python package management‚Äîa personal choice after comparing options and learning about its speed and reproducibility benefits.
    - Removed pip after installing uv to avoid cross-talk/confusion.

### 4. **Airflow CLI Not Found**
- **Issue:** Installing Airflow via uv/pip as user-only meant no `airflow` command in shell or scripts.
- **Resolution:**  
    - Installed Airflow in a dedicated venv (`/opt/airflow-venv`), then symlinked the CLI to `/usr/local/bin` for global access.

### 5. **VS Code Source Control/Extensions Not Auto-Syncing with CLI**
- **Issue:** After installing new CLI tools (like git), or changing user identity, VS Code extensions often didn‚Äôt "see" those changes right away.
- **Resolution:**  
    - **Reload the VS Code window:**  
        - Keyboard: `Ctrl+Shift+P`, then type/select ‚ÄúReload Window‚Äù.
        - Or, refresh browser tab in Codespaces web.
    - Once reloaded, extensions and Source Control sidebar work as expected and detect all CLI/config changes.
- **Lesson:** In cloud/devcontainer environments, always reload after major installs or config tweaks for UI and shell to sync up.

### 6. **Git Commit Identity/Repo Auth**
- **Issue:** Commits would sometimes fail with ‚Äúunknown author identity‚Äù or push would require GitHub login.
- **Resolution:**  
    - Set your global username/email using:
        ```
        git config --global user.name "darksolitaire9"
        git config --global user.email "darksolitaire9@gmail.com"
        ```
    - Check values at any time with:
        ```
        git config user.name
        git config user.email
        ```
    - Use these before the first commit, or VS Code/CLI may block or lose commit authorship.

## üí° Developer Process: Tips & Learning Moments

- **Always confirm your environment** with:
    ```
    cat /etc/os-release
    ```
- **Check toolchain versions** after rebuild:
    ```
    python --version && uv --version && R --version && julia --version && airflow version && git --version && ffmpeg -version && gh --version
    ```
- **After CLI or config changes:**  
    Reload VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí ‚ÄúReload Window‚Äù) to fix any Source Control/UI sync problems.
- **Set Git identity** before first commit‚Äîkeeps history clean (see above).
- **Document every new issue and solution in this README**‚Äîfuture you will thank present you!
- **Switch from pip to uv was my own research/experiment, not an AI suggestion.**

- **.gitignore ensures reproducibility and clean repo:**  
    Ignores Airflow runtime, database files, ETL outputs, media artifacts (mp4, mp3, jpg, etc), Jupyter/R/Julia/Python build files, and temp/editor logs. Only source code, essential configs, and versioned DAGs are tracked.

## üóìÔ∏è [2025-10-29] Update: ffmpeg, GitHub CLI, and .gitignore Improvements

**What changed today:**
- **ffmpeg** is now reproducibly installed in the devcontainer for programmatic media, audio, image, and ETL pipeline tasks.
- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** is installed for seamless repo management directly in the terminal/Codespace.
- **.gitignore expanded:** Now robustly ignores Airflow dbs, logs, outputs, ETL and media artifacts, temp/editor system files, and all common multi-language project build/test artifacts.
- **Full rebuild tested:** All installs, verification steps, and CLI tools confirmed working after container rebuild.
- **Documentation/logging best practice:** This dated entry records the milestone and rationale for reproducibility and streamlined collaboration.

**Verification performed:**
- ffmpeg -version
- gh --version
- ffmpeg -f lavfi -i testsrc=duration=1:size=320x240:rate=30 test_ffmpeg.mp4
- ls -lh test_ffmpeg.mp4


*Note: The switch to uv for Python was my choice, not AI-suggested!*

## üöÄ [2025-10-30] Update: Python Dependency Flow, uv, and Geocode Utility

**Today's Milestone:**  
- Setup and standardized Python dependency management using **uv** with a clean `pyproject.toml` (**no more pip!**)
- Added and tested the first pipeline helper:  
  `airflow/helpers/geocode_utils.py` ‚Äî fetches city coordinates via Open-Meteo‚Äôs geocoding API (no API keys required)
- Improved reproducibility and cross-shell dev experience (especially for Codespaces users)

---

**How it works:**
- **Dependencies are declared and versioned** in `pyproject.toml` at the project root (currently: `requests`)
- **Project venv managed with uv:**  
```

uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install .

```
- **No more guessing/side installs:**  
Install all needed packages reliably with a single command; developers just follow the README/setup
- `.devcontainer/setup.sh` and devcontainer `postCreateCommand` can automate setup for newcomers/rebuilds

**What you can do now:**
- Write, run, and extend helpers/pipeline code without worrying about global vs project-specific Python
- Use the same workflow in both local dev, Codespaces, and containerized environments

**Example Usage:**  
```

from airflow.helpers.geocode_utils import get_city_coordinates
lat, lon = get_city_coordinates("Lisbon", country="PT")
print(lat, lon)  \# e.g., 38.7071, -9.1355

```

**Commit Workflow:**  
- Add/modify dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
- Commit changes first  
```

git add pyproject.toml
git commit -m "update dependencies"

```
- Install using `uv pip install .` after pulling/merging changes

**Current Maintainer:**  
- darksolitaire9+etl@gmail.com

---

**Summary:**  
All contributors and future setups benefit from a **proven, versioned, and reproducible Python environment**, centered on uv‚Äîno more ‚Äúworks on my machine‚Äù!  
The geocoding utility is the first step in your historical/forecast weather ETL pipeline.  
Commit, pull, and build with confidence.
